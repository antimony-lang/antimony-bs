# Bootstrapped Antimony compiler

This compiler is an attempt to build an [Antimony](https://github.com/antimony-lang/antimony) compiler in Antimony itself.

## Building and running

**Note**: Another Antimony compiler needs to be installed on the system.

To run this compiler, execute `sb run src/main.sb`.

Alternatively, you can use Make to build and run the project.

`make`: builds the compiler

`make run` builds the compiler and executes the binary

## State of this compiler

This compiler is not ready to be used yet. See the [reference compiler](https://github.com/antimony-lang/antimony) for a stable implementation.
